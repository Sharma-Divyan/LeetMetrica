The LeetCode Metrics Evaluation project analyzes a user's LeetCode performance to provide meaningful insights and track coding progress over time.

It collects key data such as the number of problems solved, categories (Easy/Medium/Hard), topics covered (like Arrays, DP, Trees), daily streaks, and submission patterns. Using this data, it generates visualizations and progress summaries to help users identify strengths, weak areas, and improve their problem-solving efficiency.
